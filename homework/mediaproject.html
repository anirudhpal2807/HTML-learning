         <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
         <p>C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is widely used for system/software development and game programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension of the C programming language. C++ adds features like object-oriented programming (OOP) and other advanced programming constructs.</p>
         <h3>Features of c++</h3>
         <p>C++ is a powerful and flexible programming language that supports a variety of features, which make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from system software to game development. Here are the key features of C++:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation: Bundles data and functions together as objects, hiding internal details</li>
            <li>Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reuse.</li>
            <li>Polymorphism: Enables methods to behave differently based on the object they are called on (overloading and overriding).</li>
            <li>C++ provides direct access to memory through pointers and references, allowing fine-grained control over system resources.</li>
            <li>This feature makes C++ ideal for system programming (e.g., operating systems, embedded systems).</li>
            <li>Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features to the user.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Basic syntax</h3>
         <pre style="background-color: aqua;"><code>
            #include &lt;iostream &gt;

                using namespace std;
                
                int main() {
                cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; endl;
                return 0;
                }
         </code></pre>
         <ul>
            <li>#include &lt;iostream &gt; Preprocessor directive to include the standard input-output stream library.</li>
            <li>using namespace std;: Allows you to use standard functions like cout without qualifying them with std::.</li>
            <li>int main(): The main function where execution begins.</li>
            <li>cout: Used to print output to the console.</li>
            <li>return 0;: Indicates that the program ended successfully.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Application Of C++</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Operating Systems: C++ is used in developing operating systems like Windows, Linux (kernel), and macOS.
                Device Drivers: C++ is commonly used to write low-level device drivers for hardware components.</li>
            <li>Game Engines: C++ is widely used in developing game engines like Unreal Engine, Unity (for scripting), and CryEngine. It offers high performance and direct hardware access, essential for gaming applications.</li>
            <li>C++ is used in programming embedded systems, such as microcontrollers, robotics, automotive systems, medical devices, and consumer electronics</li>
            <li>C++ is frequently used in developing real-time systems, where precise timing, fast execution, and immediate responses are critical.</li>
            <li>High-frequency trading algorithms, banking applications, and stock market analysis software often rely on C++ due to its performance, low latency, and ability to handle large datasets quickly.</li>
         </ol>

           <section id="third">
           <h2>Introduction to Array</h2>
           <h3>What is an Array</h3>
           <p>An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays are commonly used in programming to manage and organize data efficiently.</p>
           <p>Key Features of Arrays:
            Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed during runtime.
            Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., integers, floats, or characters).
            Indexed Access: Elements in an array can be accessed using their indices (positions), starting from 0 in most programming languages.
            Contiguous Memory: Elements are stored in consecutive memory locations.</p>
           <img src="../homework/download.png" alt="Array picture"width="100%" height="450">
            <h3>Charater of Array</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Homogeneous Elements: It stores only characters.</li>
                <li>Fixed Size: The size is determined when the array is declared and cannot change during runtime.</li>
               <li>Indexed Access: Each character in the array can be accessed using its index</li>
                <li>Null Termination: In languages like C and C++, a character array representing a string must end with a null character (\0) to indicate the end of the string.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Type of Array</h3>
            <ol><li>One-Dimensional Array
                Stores elements in a single row or line.
                Simplest form of an array.
                </li>
            <li>Stores data in rows and columns (like a matrix).
                Example (in C++):
                cpp
                Copy code
                int arr[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
                cout << arr[1][2]; // Accessing the element at row 1, column 2 (outp</li>
            <li>Extends the concept of 2D arrays to higher dimensions.
                Example (3D Array in C++):
                cpp
                Copy code
                int arr[2][3][4]; // Represents a 3D array with 2 blocks, 3 rows, and</li></ol>

            <h3>Charater of tree</h3>
            <ul><li>Trees are a hierarchical data structure that organizes elements in a parent-child relationship.</li>
            <li>The topmost element is the root, and all other nodes branch out from it.
            </li>
            <li>A tree has a single root node that serves as the starting point for all elements.</li>
            <li>There is exactly one unique path between any two nodes, ensuring there are no cycles</li>
            <li>Trees are acyclic graphs, meaning they do not contain any closed loops or cycles.</li></ul>
            <h3>Type of Tree</h3>
            <ol><li>A general tree allows nodes to have any number of children</li>
            <li>Binary Tree
                Each node has at most two children: left and right.</li>
            <li>Full Binary Tree
                A binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children</li>
            <li>AVL Tree
                A self-balancing binary search tree.
                The height difference (balance factor) between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.</li>
            <li>Red-Black Tree
                A self-balancing binary search tree.

                     <h2>Introduction to Graph</h2>
                     <h3>What is graph</h3>
                     <p>In computer science and mathematics, a graph is a data structure used to represent relationships or connections between objects. A graph consists of:

                        Vertices (Nodes): Represent the objects or entities.
                        Edges (Links): Represent the relationships or connections between the vertices.
                        A graph is commonly denoted as 
                        𝐺
                        (
                        𝑉
                        ,
                        𝐸
                        )
                        G(V,E), where:
                        
                        𝑉
                        V: A set of vertices.
                        𝐸
                        E: A set of edges, where each edge connects a pair of vertices.

    <h3>Characteistic of graph</h3>
    <p>A graph is a fundamental data structure in computer science and discrete mathematics. Its characteristics depend on its structure, the type of edges, and the relationships between vertices. Below are the primary characteristics of a graph:</p>
       <ul><li>Vertices (Nodes):

        Basic units of a graph, representing entities (e.g., people, locations).</li>
       <li>Edges (Links):

        Represent the relationships between vertices.</li>
       <li>Path:

        A sequence of vertices connected by edges.</li>
       <li>Connectivity:

        Connected: A path exists between every pair of vertices.</li>
       <li>Directed or Undirected:

        Directed: Edges have a direction (one-way relationship).
        Undirected: Edges have no direction (bidirectional).</li></ul>             
 <h3>Application of Graph</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Social Networks:

        Vertices represent users, edges represent relationships or interactions (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn).</li>
    <li>Computer Networks:

        Vertices represent computers or routers, edges represent communication links between them.</li>
    <li>Navigation and Maps:

        Vertices represent locations (cities, places), edges represent roads or routes (used in GPS systems).</li>
    <li>Web Crawling:

        Graphs represent web pages (vertices) and links (edges) between them (used in search engines).</li>
    <li>Route Finding and Shortest Path:

        Used in algorithms like Dijkstra's to find the shortest path in a weighted graph (e.g., in navigation, logistics).</li>
